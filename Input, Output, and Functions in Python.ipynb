    "print(r1)\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The <code>randint()</code> function generates a random integer between two integers that we specify as inputs. However, unlike built-in functions, the module from which this function was imported must also be given, so we invoke (call) this function with the syntax <code><b>random.</b>randint()</code>. This function has the signature (inputs and outputs) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "randint(start, end) -> int\n",

However, there are times when we need to run certain lines (or blocks) of code if a condition is true, or skip them if the condition is false. The ability to jump or branch to a different part of a body of code is built in to the instruction set of a computer's CPU (central processing unit), and carries over into higher-level programming languages like C++, Java, and Python.\n",

    "But now, suppose we want to make the turtle trace a square of a side length that is not 100 pixels, but some value that we specify in advance. We don't want to have to change the value <code>100</code> each time it appears in the code above with the new value. The way to do this is to use a variable to which we assign the side length. Run the cell below a few times, but change the value of <code>sidelen</code> each time to a number between 0 and 200. What happens if you use a negative number?"

    "In the previous notebook, you may have also discovered that, in order to make a square (regular polygon of 4 sides), the turtle needs to make a turn at each corner whose angle is 360°/4 = 90°, while making a regular octagon (8 sides), the turtle needs to turn 360°/8 = 45° at each corner. Likewise, to make a regular hexagon (6 sides), the turtle needs to turn 360°/6 = 60° at each corner. What if we want to make a regular polygon having a specified number of sides that we specify in advance? We can do this using an expression for <code>angle</code> to which we assign the value <code>360 / numsides</code>, where <code>numsides</code> is the number of sides.\n",
