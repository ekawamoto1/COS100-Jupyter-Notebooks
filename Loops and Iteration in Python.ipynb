    "### 1. Loops: Repeating a Process\n",
    "There are times when we need to repeat a task (a single line, or a block of code) multiple times. Just how many times may be specified in advance, it may be specified by the user, or it may depend on what's happening inside the task. We will use the same idea of comparison, which we introduced for conditionals (<code>if</code> statements), to tell us how many times to iterate (repeat) the code in a loop. <br>\n",

    "Once again, note that <code>=</code> is NOT the same as the equality relation (\"is equal to\") in mathematics. This is because the quantities on the LHS and RHS of <code>=</code> are NOT interchangeable. Instead, by the syntax rules of Python (and many other coding languages), the only thing that can be on the left side of the <code>=</code> operator is a lone variable whose value is being assigned. This variable cannot be part of an expression - it is just the variable itself. On the RHS of the <code>=</code> operator, there can be an expression which evaluates to a value which is being assigned to the variable on the left side of <code>=</code>. <br>\n",

    "#### The <code>while</code> block\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, remember that the operators ```<```, ```>```, ```≤```, ```≥```, ```==```, and ```!=``` are <b>relational</b> or <b>comparison operators</b>. Relational expressions evaluate the expressions on the operator's LH and RH sides, compare their values, and return the Boolean values ```True``` or ```False``` depending on the relationship between those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will use these relational operator expressions in an <code>while</code> statement, which will execute the indented code block immediately following it <b>while</b> the expression evaluates to <code>True</code>, and will exit the loop (continuing execution after the <code>while</code> block) when the expression no longer evaluates to <code>True</code>. Note how this loop construct also has a special format - the keyword <code>while</code>, followed by the relational expression, followed by a colon (<code>:</code>). The code block that executes if the expression is <code>True</code> MUST BE indented: <br>\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "while (LHS_expr rel_op RHS_expr) == True:\n",
    "    do something\n",
    "    do something\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The <code>do something</code> lines are executed ONLY IF <code>LHS_expr rel_op RHS_expr</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>; otherwise, those lines are not run, and the program resumes execution after the last indented line of the <code>while</code>-block. A shortcut for this is to leave out the <code>== True</code> altogether. If the Boolean expression in parentheses evaluates to <code>True</code>, it is superfluous to test whether <code>True == True</code>. Thus, the more common way of writing the <code>while</code> construct is:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "while LHS_expr rel_op RHS_expr:\n",
    "    do something\n",
    "    do something\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, this looks very similar to a conditional, an <code>if</code>-block. However, if the relational expression following the keyword <code>while</code> is always <code>True</code>, the <code>do something</code> lines will execute over and over again, stopping only if the user intervenes to exit the program. This so-called \"infinite loop\" is not very useful. Thus, we must introduce the notion of a <b>loop counter</b>, which is a numerical variable of integer type. We use this to count how many times we have run the <code>do something</code> lines, incrementing this counter by 1 each time. When the counter reaches the number of times we want to run the loop, the program exits the <code>while</code>-block, and resumes execution after the last indented line.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how this works, in the code cell below, try changing the value of <code>numIter</code> to a different value, to zero, or to a negative number, and run the cell to see what happens."

    "This is a more compact way of handling the loop counter variable <code>i</code> - it is defined, initialized, incremented, and compared with the number of times we want to iterate the loop, all in an expression following the keyword <code>for</code>. However, in Python, this construct does not exist as such. Instead, the loop counter is *generated* by a so-called <code>range</code> object. This saves us the trouble of initializing and incrementing a loop counter variable inside the <code>for</code>-block.\n",

    "In all of these, ```start```, ```stop```, and ```step``` must all be integers. If ```start >= stop``` and ```step > 0```, no integers will be generated by ```range()```. Also, ```step``` must be nonzero, or an error will result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is used in a <code>for</code>-loop, which looks similar to <code>if</code>- and <code>while</code>-blocks, and takes the general form:\n",

    "In the previous notebook, you may have also discovered that, in order to make a square (regular polygon of 4 sides), the turtle needs to make a turn at each corner whose angle is 360°/4 = 90°, while making a regular octagon (8 sides), the turtle needs to turn 360°/8 = 45° at each corner. Likewise, to make a regular hexagon (6 sides), the turtle needs to turn 360°/6 = 60° at each corner. What if we want to make a regular polygon having a specified number of sides that we specify in advance? We can do this using an expression for <code>angle</code> to which we assign the value <code>360 / numsides</code>, where <code>numsides</code> is the number of sides.\n",
