    "### 1. Creating and Using Variables\n",
    "A variable is simply a container that holds data. In Python, there's a lot more under the hood of a variable than that, but for now, that's all you need to know. <br>\n",
    "A variable is like a reservation at a restaurant. It sets aside space in memory to hold a piece of information, some data. The name of a variable is how one refers to that information. If we print out what that variable contains or holds, we get a literal value. Just as in algebra, a variable stands in for a specific literal value. The contents of a variable (the value it holds) can change, hence the name 'variable'. "

    "\n",
    "In mathematics, equality (denoted by <code>=</code>) and inequality (denoted by <code>≠</code>, or more precisely, by ```<```, ```>```, ```≤```, or ```≥```) express a <b>relationship</b> between two mathematical expressions. For an equality relation <code>A = B</code>, expressions <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> have the same value. Likewise, for an inequality like ```A < B```, expression <code>A</code> evaluates to a value that is less than the value that expression <code>B</code> evaluates to. However, in coding, the left-hand side expression ```A``` is a single variable, while ```B``` is an expression whose value may depend on the values of other variables. In this case, the relation ```A == B``` is not an assignment of the value of expression ```B``` to variable ```A```, nor is it an equation to be solved. Instead, it is a <b>proposition</b> which may sometimes be true, and sometimes be false, depending on what values the expression ```B``` can take. We will learn more about propositions later on, in preparation for conditionals (```if```-statements).\n",

    "In Python, as in Java, C, C++, C#, and many other coding languages, symbols such as ```<```, ```>```, ```≤```, ```≥```, ```==```, and ```!=``` are known as <b>relational</b> or <b>comparison operators</b>. Correct expressions that contain these operators return a Boolean value of <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.
